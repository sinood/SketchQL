                                      ======== About ========                                        

SketchQL is a database management application for SQL users to edit and execute SQL statements. SketchQL uses the SQLite3 database engine to create a database which users can manage using their own SQL statements.

This application is intended to function as a sketchpad for individual users. SketchQL is not ideal for:

- Very large data

- More complex SQL statements

- Professional use

These limitations of the SQLite3 engine make SketchQL better suited for small-scale projects, database planning and sketching, creating, populating, viewing, and editing data, etc. SketchQL provides:

- Fast processing of SQL statements with the reliable SQLite3 engine

- Output table formatting with the pandas library

- A simple, friendly interface for recreational SQL development

- Sample data to test app features and get used to SketchQL

All data is stored in-application on a database.sqlite3 file, so changes will be saved upon closing and reopening the application. 


                                   ======== Requirements ========         

- SketchQL is currently only compatible with Mac OS.


                                   ======== Installation ========                                     

In the "dist" folder, there should be an executable file titled "SketchQL." Open this file to run the program, and begin using SketchQL.
